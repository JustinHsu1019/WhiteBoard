# White Board - Cloud-based Electronic Whiteboard
## Introduction:
This application is a simple electronic whiteboard that allows users to draw directly in their browsers. It supports not only mouse drawing but also touch screens. Users can choose different brush sizes and colors and have buttons for functions like clear, pen, eraser, previous page, and next page.

## Key Features:
1. Brush Selection: Users can choose the color and size of the brush.
2. Full Screen: Offers users a full-screen mode for drawing.
3. Clear: Allows users to clear the canvas.
4. Pen/Eraser Toggle: Users can choose to use the pen or eraser function.
5. Page Switching: Supports multi-page functionality, allowing users to switch within 200 pages.

## How to Use:
1. Open index.html in your browser.
2. Draw using the mouse or touch screen.
3. Use the toolbar on the right to adjust brush size, color, or utilize other function buttons.

## Technical Details:
1. HTML & CSS: Establish the user interface and styling.
2. JavaScript & jQuery: Handle drawing functions, brush selection, page switching, etc.
3. Canvas: Drawing is done using the HTML5 Canvas API.

## Areas for Improvement:
1. The current storage mechanism relies on localstorage. Plans are in place to migrate it to the server-side for optimized data management.
2. Planning to introduce a shared whiteboard feature, allowing users to co-draw with friends and family, collaboratively completing artworks.
3. Expand functionalities, adding background selection and image import options, providing users with more diverse sources of drawing inspiration.
4. Optimize and beautify the user interface, making it more intuitive and user-friendly.
